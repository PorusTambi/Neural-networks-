# Neural-networks-
This code I have written as an assignment given on week 5 on coursera "MACHINE LEARNING" course by Prof. Andrew Ng Stanford university 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) This has ex4 folder which contains various scipts written in octave/matlab programming language
2) It has pdf ex4 which tells about a task which is accomplished with this code 
3) The neural networks code is just global and it can be used for different purposes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EXPLANATION OF SCRIPTS
1) ex4.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise
2) ex4data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits 
3) ex4weights.mat - Neural network parameters for exercise 4
4) submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to COURSERA servers
5) displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset
6) fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
7) sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function 
8) computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients
9) checkNNGradients.m - Function to help check your gradients
10) debugInitializeWeights.m - Function for initializing weights 
11) predict.m - Neural network prediction function 
12) sigmoidGradient.m - Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function
13) randInitializeWeights.m - Randomly initialize weights 
14) nnCostFunction.m - Neural network cost function

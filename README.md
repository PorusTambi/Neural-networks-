# Neural-networks-
This code I have wriitten as an assignment given on week 5 on coursera "MACHINE LEARNING" course by Prof. Andrew Ng Stanford university 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) This has ex4 folder which contains various scipts written in octave/matlab programming language
2) It has pdf ex4 which tells about a task which is accomplished with this code 
3) The neural networks code is just global and it can be used for different purposes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       EXPLANATION OF SCRIPTS
ex4.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise
ex4data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits 
ex4weights.mat - Neural network parameters for exercise 4
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to COURSERA servers
displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function 
computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients
checkNNGradients.m - Function to help check your gradients
debugInitializeWeights.m - Function for initializing weights 
predict.m - Neural network prediction function 
sigmoidGradient.m - Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function
 randInitializeWeights.m - Randomly initialize weights 
 nnCostFunction.m - Neural network cost function
